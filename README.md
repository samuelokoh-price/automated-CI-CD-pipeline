# Automated AWS CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform, Ansible & Docker

An end-to-end Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system that automatically validates application changes, provisions AWS infrastructure, builds and publishes a Docker image, configures an EC2 host, deploys the application stack, and exposes monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana.

The project combines **CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, configuration management, containerization, reverse proxying, and observability** into one reproducible workflow.

## 📐 CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

This diagram shows the **flow of a code change** from the developer's machine to the running application.

```

### Pipeline stages

1. **Validate** — GitHub Actions runs the application's PyTest test suite.
2. **Provision** — Terraform creates or updates the required AWS infrastructure and uses remote state stored in S3.
3. **Package** — Docker Buildx builds and tags the application image and pushes it to Docker Hub.
4. **Configure & Deploy** — Ansible connects to the dynamically created EC2 instance, configures the host, pulls the image, and launches the containerized stack.

## 🏗️ Runtime / Production Architecture

This is the **infrastructure and application architecture** that exists after deployment. It is separate from the CI/CD pipeline above: the first diagram explains **how changes get deployed**, while this diagram explains **what is running in production**.

## 🛠️ Core Engineering Technology Stack

| Area | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Source Control | Git / GitHub | Stores source code and triggers the workflow |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Automates validation, provisioning, packaging, and deployment |
| Testing | PyTest | Validates application behaviour automatically |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform v1.7.0 | Provisions and manages AWS infrastructure |
| Cloud | AWS | Provides the production infrastructure |
| Remote Terraform State | Amazon S3 | Stores Terraform state remotely |
| Configuration Management | Ansible | Configures the EC2 host and performs deployment tasks |
| Containers | Docker / Docker Buildx | Packages and runs the application |
| Registry | Docker Hub | Stores and distributes the application image |
| Reverse Proxy | Nginx | Provides the public HTTP entry point and forwards traffic to the application |
| Metrics | Prometheus | Collects and stores operational metrics |
| Monitoring UI | Grafana | Visualizes metrics through dashboards |
| Host Metrics | Node Exporter | Exposes host-level metrics to Prometheus |

## 🚀 Key Architectural Automations

1. **Automated Terraform State Initialization** — The deployment workflow checks for the Terraform S3 backend and uses `terraform init -reconfigure` when required so the workflow can correctly connect to the remote state backend across runs.

2. **Dynamic Host Inventory Resolution** — Terraform outputs live EC2 instance information to GitHub Actions through `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, allowing the deployment stage to pass the current target host to Ansible without hard-coding an IP address.

3. **Automated SSH Connection Refresh** — Ansible uses `ansible.builtin.meta: reset_connection` to refresh the SSH session when required after host/network configuration changes.

4. **Docker Bridge-Based Internal Communication** — The monitoring components communicate through the Docker bridge/network rather than requiring every internal service to be exposed publicly.

## 🔧 Operational Configuration

The deployment workflow requires the following GitHub Actions secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS authentication |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS authentication |
| `ANSIBLE_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key used by Ansible to access the EC2 host |
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Docker Hub authentication |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Docker Hub Personal Access Token |

Configure these under:

**GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

> **Security:** Never commit these values, private keys, `.pem` files, or other credentials to the repository.

## ⚠️ Scope

This is a portfolio project designed to demonstrate production-oriented DevOps practices on a small AWS deployment. The architecture intentionally keeps the infrastructure relatively simple: a single EC2 production host running the application and monitoring containers.

The project demonstrates the **engineering workflow and operational concepts** used in larger environments without claiming that this small deployment has the scale or redundancy of a large enterprise platform.
